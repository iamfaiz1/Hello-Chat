This is a simple chatting app, I've used Socket.IO and build it on Nodejs.
it allows user to connect to the single-roomed chat (more than 2 users can be present and chat simultaniously to eachother (A goupchat).
user just have to enter their name (cant be null) and start chatting with others.

// Future upgrades
-current user count
-better UI
-1v1 room
-random chatting room 1v1
